      <h3>About PLANr</h3>
      <span>We all have too much to do an just not enough time. Thankfully technology 
        has offered us the opportunity to accurately plan out our day to day. Just one 
        small problem though, and that is the planners themselves. Planning is a very 
        quick process that involves many decisions initially and many small adjustments 
        as time passes, so why are so many planning applications so clunky and slow? 
        That is where PLANr comes in. A simplistic planning app that aims to convey what 
        you already had in mind and does it quickly and easily. Just add in the plan you 
        have for your day event by event, shift it around as you please, and then 
        execute your plan.</span>
