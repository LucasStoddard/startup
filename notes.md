# Notes
What I've learned is that github commands are *far* from intuitive, but not much in Computer Science is very intuitive.
The basic commands I need are
```
git fetch
git status
git pull
git commit "changes"
git push
```

Ok I'm still really confused about the differentiation between WebSocket data and Database data, and I think it may come from the fact that I am using both together, as the data users are putting into the calendar is database data, but the old events that were stored count as WebSocket data. It will take me a while to fully understand this but I am waiting to cross that bridge for now.
